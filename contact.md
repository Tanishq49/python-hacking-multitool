Hey there! Thanks for stopping by my GitHub. Whether youâ€™re a fellow developer, an open-source enthusiast, or someone who just wants to talk tech, Iâ€™d love to connect! I'm always open to collaboration on interesting projects, discussing new ideas, or just having a friendly chat about programming, design, or anything creative. You can reach out to me anytime through email at nottanishqbhandari@gmail.com.

Iâ€™m also quite active on Discord, where I hang out, contribute to dev communities, and sometimes help troubleshoot or brainstorm project ideas. Feel free to send me a message or friend request â€” my Discord username is Tanishq. Donâ€™t hesitate to reach out; I genuinely enjoy meeting new people and learning from others in the tech world.

Looking forward to hearing from you! ðŸ˜Š
